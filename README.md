# Superjoin Hiring Assignment

### Welcome to Superjoin's hiring assignment! üöÄ

### Objective
Build a solution that enables real-time synchronization of data between a Google Sheet and a specified database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). The solution should detect changes in the Google Sheet and update the database accordingly, and vice versa.

### Problem Statement
Many businesses use Google Sheets for collaborative data management and databases for more robust and scalable data storage. However, keeping the data synchronised between Google Sheets and databases is often a manual and error-prone process. Your task is to develop a solution that automates this synchronisation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other in real-time.

### Requirements:
1. Real-time Synchronisation
  - Implement a system that detects changes in Google Sheets and updates the database accordingly.
   - Similarly, detect changes in the database and update the Google Sheet.
  2.	CRUD Operations
   - Ensure the system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both Google Sheets and the database.
   - Maintain data consistency across both platforms.
   
### Optional Challenges (This is not mandatory):
1. Conflict Handling
- Develop a strategy to handle conflicts that may arise when changes are made simultaneously in both Google Sheets and the database.
- Provide options for conflict resolution (e.g., last write wins, user-defined rules).
    
2. Scalability: 	
- Ensure the solution can handle large datasets and high-frequency updates without performance degradation.
- Optimize for scalability and efficiency.

## Submission ‚è∞
The timeline for this submission is: **Next 2 days**

Some things you might want to take care of:
- Make use of git and commit your steps!
- Use good coding practices.
- Write beautiful and readable code. Well-written code is nothing less than a work of art.
- Use semantic variable naming.
- Your code should be organized well in files and folders which is easy to figure out.
- If there is something happening in your code that is not very intuitive, add some comments.
- Add to this README at the bottom explaining your approach (brownie points üòã)
- Use ChatGPT4o/o1/Github Co-pilot, anything that accelerates how you work üí™üèΩ. 

Make sure you finish the assignment a little earlier than this so you have time to make any final changes.

Once you're done, make sure you **record a video** showing your project working. The video should **NOT** be longer than 120 seconds. While you record the video, tell us about your biggest blocker, and how you overcame it! Don't be shy, talk us through, we'd love that.

We have a checklist at the bottom of this README file, which you should update as your progress with your assignment. It will help us evaluate your project.

- [x] My code's working just fine! ü•≥
- [x] I have recorded a video showing it working and embedded it in the README ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- [x] I have tested all the normal working cases üòé
- [x] I have even solved some edge cases (brownie points) üí™
- [x] I added my very planned-out approach to the problem at the end of this README üìú

**Approach To The Problem -**

*   **Polling for Changes**:
    *   The program continuously polls multiple Google Sheets to detect changes.
    *   It compares the current sheet data with an in-memory hash to identify modifications.
    *   If changes are detected, the program updates the database and triggers the synchronization process.

*   **Use of Go and Goroutines for Concurrency**:
    *   Go was chosen due to its lightweight concurrency model, which is crucial for handling multiple sheets simultaneously.
    *   **Goroutines** enable the program to poll multiple sheets concurrently, ensuring each sheet is checked in parallel without blocking other operations.
    *   This concurrent approach drastically improves efficiency, especially when working with multiple Google Sheets, as the program can handle polling, database operations, and syncing in parallel.

*   **Efficient Database Storage**:
    *   Upon detecting changes, the program saves the updated sheet data into a MySQL database as JSON.
    *   It also updates the timestamp in a dedicated `timestamps` table, which tracks the last time each sheet was modified.
    *   The use of timestamps ensures that the latest data is always prioritized and outdated information is ignored.

*   **Synchronization Across Sheets**:
    *   After storing the updated data in the database, the program retrieves the latest version and pushes it to all other Google Sheets.
    *   This ensures all sheets remain consistent and up-to-date with the most recent changes, no matter where the updates originated.

*   **Conflict Resolution Using Timestamps**:
    *   By tracking the last write timestamp for each sheet, the program ensures that only the most recent data is propagated across the other sheets.
    *   This mechanism prevents conflicts, ensuring that no older or outdated data overwrites newer updates during synchronization.

*   **Data Integrity**:
    *   The program verifies data consistency through hashing, storing only changed data in the database, and synchronizing the sheets accordingly.
    *   Hashes and timestamps are central to avoiding redundant writes and ensuring that data integrity is maintained.
